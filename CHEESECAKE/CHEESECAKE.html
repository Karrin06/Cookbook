                        <ol>
                            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
                            <li>In a medium bowl, combine graham crumbs, sugar, and butter. Mix until well combined and press into the bottom and about ¾-inch up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
                            <li>In a medium bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until fluffy, scraping the sides as neede. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until just until incorporated (do not overbeat, this will cause cracks).</li>
                            <li>Pour the cheesecake batter into the prepared crust and wrap the bottom of the springform pan in 2 layers of aluminum foil. Place the springform pan in a large roasting pan and pour enough water in the roasting pan to reach halfway up the springform pan. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Once the cheesecake is set, turn the oven off, open the door slightly, and allow the cheesecake to cool in the oven for 1 hour.</li>
                            <li>Remove from the oven and run a butter knife along the edges. Remove from springform pan and cool completely in the fridge for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
                            <li>Remove springform pan and cool completely in the fridge at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
